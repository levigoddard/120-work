# *Week Three Summary*

This week I, quite surprisingly, had very little in the way of problems. While the website was down for most of the week, I did finally manage to finish the assignment. I do better with reading and following along. This had me open Atom and Firefox at 50% each. I learned about .js and p5 as well as index.html.

# *Further Discussion*

I would like to know about what most websites use in relation to HTML and codes like it. I am sure we will learn about it more later in this course. If we do not, I would like to get a brief overview or links to such information.
