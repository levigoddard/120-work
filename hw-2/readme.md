# *Summary*
In this lesson I learned how to better use Atom and Git for coding. I worked on programs like GitBash and GitOnline, as well as learning how to use .md files. While having several issues, I mannaged to solve them with help from my classmates.
# *Steps I Took*
1. The first thing I did was download Atom and GitHub Desktop
2. After downloading the recomended files for Atom, something that ended up becoming a tremendous help, I created the .txt file
3. I then did some research on versions and version control
4. After changing my name and git, a bit late thanks to some issues, I installed GitHub Desktop and set it up
5. After set up I posted my .txt as instructed and created this readme.md
# *Issues*
..* I initially Had issues with file permissions inside GitBash to change the global name and email
- I was informed I needed to run it as administrator and it worked
..* I struggled to change a .txt to .md
- I was shown how to go into the settings and make myself able to change it
# *What I Learned*
1. I learned how to create a .md file from a .txt.
2. I learned how to create a git repository and how to save it in a way to see each version and change.
3. I learned what mark down was and how it differed from a normal text folder.
4. I learned more about the differences between a text and word document.
