# *Week Four Summary*
  This week I Worked on a self-image using p5.js. I based most of my image using rect(). The reason I did this is because I view myself as a very boxy like person and this allowed me better design choices. I Went with a dark red background to contrast my shirt and pants. I moved the image to the bottom of the image to make it fit in the picture better. After finishing I lightened the skin tone and shortened the image to make the image look better and fit better.
