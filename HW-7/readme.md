# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing

Line 3 to 10 create the variable (3) and the math controlling the balls size, angle of attack and speed. ball.x and .y control the start location, .delta_x and y control the angle and scale controls speed. The function setup on line 12 is where the code is set up for the entire time. createCanvas and background create the setting of the program by setting it's size and color. In this case the window is set to the width of the browser and a height of 400 pixels with a white background. In line 19 you have the draw function which is where the code is created. lines 21 to 34 the circle is created. 36 down sets what happens when you click based off where you click.


## How did you alter the sketch?

The first thing I did was change the size and starting location of the circle. I then added a color fill to the circle. I also speed up the ball and changed the angle of attack by increasing ball.delta.
